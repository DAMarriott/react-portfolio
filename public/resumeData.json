    "bio": "I dove head first the second I finally realized and understood my passion for coding. I love to constantly learn new skills and use them to develop interesting projects. I love what I do so it hardly feels like work. When I step away from the keyboard, I like to be outside: playing sports, hiking, lounging on the beach while listening to anything from Kanye to Led Zeppelin. I appreciate tasty food aand having a good conversation over a great meal. I love reading all genres and playing all different sorts of video games.",
