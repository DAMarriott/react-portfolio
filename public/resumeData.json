    "bio": "I am on a journey to improve myself each and every day, motivated by an insatiable intellectual curiosty and a need to become the very best version of myself. I want to leave my mark on the world and leave it a better place than I found it. I built my first computer at 14 and have been a tech enthusiast ever since. I've always been good with people so I decided to try sales after I graduated from college, but after chasing checks for a few years and lacking any real job satisfaction, I decided to return to my techie roots. I love what I do now so it hardly feels like work.",
